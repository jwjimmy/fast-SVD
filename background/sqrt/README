DESCRIPTION
-----------
This archive contains a simple and readable ANSI C implementation of some
square root approximation algorithms, including the algorithm used by the
original ENIAC computer, successive approximation, and bisection.  This
implementation is not intended to be the best, fastest, smallest, or any
other performance related adjective.

There are other known algorithms that are much faster than these algorithms.
I implemented these algorithms out of personal interest.

Successive approximation and bisection are popular techniques and widely
discussed.

BUILDING
--------
To build these files with GNU make and gcc, simply enter "make" from the
command line.

Note: The Makefile assumes the use of gcc in a Linux or Windows environment.
Other environments may require customization.

USAGE
-----
Usage:  sample <number of random squares>

The sample code will generate <number of random squares> squares and display
the square root computed by each algorithm in comparison with the value
computed by the sqrt() function in the C math library.
